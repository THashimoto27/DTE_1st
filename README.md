## Assumptions and Settings

### Human beings

#### Assumptions
- Human beings is like animal who accords only two desires (the desire of appetite and sleeping) for their acts.
  
- They gonna be dead if the desire of appetite is lower than 100
  
- They gonna be sleep if the desire of sleeping is lower than 5 until it will be restored at around 90
  
- No memory, No other desire

#### Settings

##### Behavior Tree

### Environment
- Apples are on the ground which can be eaten by human beings.

### Community
- No any restrictions

## Simulation Video
- I tried to execution this simulation at 25 times

## Result

### Time

In this case, their consumtion is for only foods (apple) and that connects directly with their HP.
So, their level of the utility shows their lifetime span in this simulation.

With results on it, the average of their lifetime span is 177.05.

And then, their activity for HP is in the following.

Once they got sleep, they stop their activity to get HP, so they gonna dead before they will get slep at the second time.
Besides on this, this case does not give new food at the same place as they got it at once. So, as time goes, it will be harder for them to find new food.

## Conclusion

This case is the most simple to find an food at the Digital Twin for Economic model with two persons. There are two human beings with two desires for appetite adn sleep but without any memories. Also, the environment has multiple foods regularly, and so human beings are going to try to find them to have. Also, there are no restriction by community.

As a result of this, the average of their lifetime span is 177.05. They cannot live a life two days because they get starving in their slept and it is going to be harder for them to find new food as time goes.
